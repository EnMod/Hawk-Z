# Hawk-Z

2013 senior games project at TCNJ, forked from our project manager's upload of our files.

### Premise

Hawk-Z is an on-rails shooter, borrowing elements from the SNES classic StarFox.  In it you control a hawk who awakes from sleep, only to notice he's now a cyborg!  

### Development

We had to basically build and develop the entire game - from scratch - in the course of about three and a half months.  It was hard work by all members of the team, but by the end of the semester we produced a fully functional, single-level version of the concept.  It's this version that you see in this repo.
